# Games with Words

## Overview
Games with Words is a project that was inspired by browser game grab-bag websites. All of the games that are currently supported and currently under construction will have something to do with words. This is the first full-stack project that I'm creating on my own, so there are lots of great opportunities to learn along the way!

## Tech Stack
On the front-end, I am using VueJS as my front-end framework and Vite as my build tool. So far, I've absolutely loved how fast things update while I build the UI.

For the back-end, I will be implementing a serverless architecture with in Amazon AWS using API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB.

For deployment, I will be using Amazon S3 to host the static files built by Vite. I will be using GitHub Actions to automate the process of deploying the code each time I merge to the main branch.
